# Basic-clicker-game
Created a Clicker game for a CS project

Clicker 2 webserver is a folder with code that my professor wrote for us to visualize the changes we were making to our clicker game
My professor also wrote the code for the 'desktopapp' and 'networking' folder in the main clicker 2 folder

Rest was written by me
